A security is relevant if any of the search query is a substring of or exact
match to any of its street IDs, case-insensitive. The closer the search query
is to an exact match, the more relevant it is.

The search engine is pre-programmed to prioritize certain street ID types over
others. In this case, exact matches are still dictate the most relevant
securities, but the relevance of partial matches is directly proportional
to the priority of the street ID type. 

For example, let’s say Sedol codes have a higher priority than Cusip codes.
Security 1 has a Sedol code of “ABC1” and a Cusip code of “XY1”, and Security 2
has a Sedol code of “XYZ4” and a Cusip code of “ABC2”. If the query is “XY”,
then Security 2 is more relevant than Security 1.

Design a dynamic model for determining the priority of street ID types. Allow
the end user to actually select a result from the returned list of securities,
and use that selection to determine which street ID types are more commonly
searched for. Use this dynamic priority as the relevance measure for partial
matches.
